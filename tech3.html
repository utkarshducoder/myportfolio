                </h2>
                <p class = "pp">
                One of the most important factors in SEO ranking is the amount of time people spend on your website page or we can say that how long people spend their time on your page. So we provide you a few ways which will help you in making your visitors interested in your website about this we'll talk about more of those in later but one of the most important ways is to make your content in such a manner that becomes user friendly in nature.
                </p>

<h2 class = "hey">2. Fix Your Broken Links</h2>
<p class = "pp">
Talking from the reader side, if any reader wants to click-through either to read or watch another piece of content that you have told them about in your main content then provide them the links and make sure the links which you are providing are not broken, if it is broken then you're creating a bad user experience. There are mainly two types of broken backlinks that you want to fix which are:
<br>·  Internal backlinks from one page of your website to another.<br>
·  Outbound backlinks from another website to your website.</p>
<br>
<h2 class = "hey">3. Don't Skip Out On Your Meta description
</h2>
<p class = "pp">
Meta description has nothing to do with your SEO ranking but it does affect in terms of the content that you have put into it, it directly affects whether people click on your content or not. You can boost your SEO ranking by having a killer meta description that makes people feel like it's impossible not to click on your article.
So if you want more attention on your website then don't forget to use proper meta description.
<p>
<br>
<h2 class = "hey">4. Update Older Content And Republish
</h2>
<p class = "pp">
Skill is the key to success so if you have created any post on any topic then don't go deeper into it just reuse that post and try just try to make a blog from that post which is more attractive for people. So to make you more clear, it all means that you don't even need to create a new post you only need to do one thing which is just change the publish date and publish it again.
</p><br>
<h2 class = "hey">5. Prioritize Your Content
</h2><p class = "pp">
We should be wise enough to give our content more priority than other's and this is possible by creating an advertisement for our website. So ads also play an important role in SEO ranking. In our own website, we can use pop-ups, Google ads, or ads for your own products all over your website, but it is a very dangerous SEO game to play.
So always try to keep your content at a high priority so that your content will go first and finally you're building a trustworthy relationship with your new website visitor. As a result, it increases your page duration and finally your SEO ranking.
